3,Novel,The Old Man and the Sea,127,Ernest Hemingway,"(July 21, 1899 – July 2, 1961) was an American journalist, novelist, short-story writer, and sportsman.

He published seven novels, six short-story collections, and two nonfiction works. Three of his novels, four short-story collections, and three nonfiction works were published posthumously.

His wartime experiences formed the basis for his novel A Farewell to Arms (1929).","The Old Man and the Sea is a short novel about an epic battle between an old Cuban fisherman and a giant fish. Hemingway uses the simple story as a fable which explores the themes of challenge, courage, survival, defeat and personal triumph.Hemingway is famous for his clean, minimalist style of writing, which is perfect for language learners.  Using short sentences and getting straight to the point, every level of an English learner will find the language accessible.","http://www.arvindguptatoys.com/arvindgupta/oldmansea.pdf	"

10,Short.story,‘Salt Slow’, 208, Julia Armfield,"Julia Armfield is a fiction writer and occasional playwright with a Masters in Victorian Art and Literature from Royal Holloway University. Her work has been published in The White Review, Lighthouse, Analog Magazine, Neon Magazine and The Stockholm Review. She was commended in the Moth Short Story Prize 2017 and won the White Review Short Story Prize with two of the stories in this collection. She lives in London, where she is at work on her debut novel.","You might have already heard great things about this collection – and we’re here to tell you that they are all true. Yet this is a set of unnerving, creepy and otherworldly stories where you second guess what to take literally. Armfield has the ability to make the surreal feel typical – her storytelling is so assured that you accept her backdrops and characters – from a Catholic schoolgirl who morphs into a huge predatory insect and devours a boy to the personification of sleep – without question.Just when you think you’ve got the measure of her talents, Armfield reveals another string to her bow, she is also incredibly funny. We laughed out loud at this from “The Collectables”: “Someone had once told Miriam that she looked like Princess Anne and this throwaway comment had come, over time, to form the basis of her whole personality. She wore green velvet loafers year round, pinned her hair in the shape of a pumpkin, spoke like her molars were made of glass.” This is such a confident and brilliant work. Armfield has the rare gift of looking like she doesn’t need to try.",https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/julia-armfield/salt-slow/9781529012569
11,Short.story,Fabulous,224,Lucy Hughes-Hallett,"Lucy Hughes-Hallett is the author of The Pike: Gabriele D’Annunzio, which won the Samuel Johnson Prize, the Duff Cooper Prize, the Political Book Award for Political Biography of the Year, and the Costa Biography Award; Cleopatra: Histories, Dreams and Distortions, which won the Fawcett Prize and the Emily Toth Award; and Heroes: Saviours, Traitors and Supermen. She lives in London.","Never judge a book by its cover, right? And don’t. Because this cover with its hazy rainbow smear and trite title, seems totally incongruous to its contents – which are clever, unusual and highly original. Especially when you consider that the etymology of “fabulous” is in fact “fable”.Hughes-Hallett has taken characters from ancient mythology, fable and folklore and dragged them kicking and screaming into the here and now. She retells these stories against this modern backdrop.At the end of the book is a section in which Hughes-Hallett summarises the fables from which she derived the stories retold in Fabulous. You might find yourself comparing the two tellings of the same tale, noticing how Hughes-Hallett treats certain elements – how she molds them to suit her new story. This certainly adds another layer of appreciation for what is already excellent writing.The standout story is “Actaeon”, in which we meet a dazzling but arrogant estate agent whose fall from grace – and to his death as it turns out – comes after he is caught peeking at his boss as she showers. His boss is called Diana – and Diana was, in ancient mythology, a goddess who was stared at as she bathed in the nude by an ill-fated hunter. This is a strange and rather brilliant collection – and if you knew nothing about fable or myth before, your appetite will be well and truly whet.",https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/9780008334857/fabulous/
12,Economics,Hall of Mirrors,520,Barry Eichengreen,"Barry Eichengreen is Professor of Economics and Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley. His previous books include Exorbitant Privilege: The Rise and Fall of the Dollar and the Future of the International Monetary System and Golden Fetters: The Gold Standard and the Great Depression, 1919-1939.","We have been here before. Sort of. Eichengreen’s work tells the parallel stories of the banking crisis and Great Depression of 1929-33, and after, and the financial crisis and Great Recession of 2007-10, and after. Some of the parallels are sufficiently “mirrored” to be reassuring. All that central banks and governments have done to stimulate economies in the last decade or so is in stark contrast to the errors and confusions of the previous era (when economic science was insufficiently well advanced to help practical policy – Keynes’ greatest work, the General Theory, did not emerge until 1936 after all). Yet, as we can all see only too clearly, our economic problems are far from over. ",https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvc77hqf
13,Economics,The Euro,512,Joseph Stiglitz,"Joseph E. Stiglitz is a professor of economics at Columbia University and the recipient of a John Bates Clark Medal and a Nobel Prize. He is also the former senior vice president and chief economist of the World Bank. His books include Globalization and Its Discontents, The Three Trillion Dollar War, and Making Globalization Work. He lives in New York City.","Gone a bit quiet, hasn’t it, the Eurozone crisis? Not so long ago you could hardly move for Greek debt disasters and busted Spanish banks. Professor Stiglitz renders the signal service to the world of reminding us that the euro, as a concept, is fatally, fundamentally and inherently flawed. A common currency without a common fiscal system and a common political entity to enforce and support it is no currency at all. We have not heard the last of the Eurozone’s troubles. An important book.","https://emf.neocities.org/tmp/TheEuro.pdf	"
14,Economics,Between Debt and the Devil ,320,Adair Turner,"Jonathan Adair Turner, Baron Turner of Ecchinswell is a British businessman and academic and was Chairman of the Financial Services Authority until its abolition in March 2013. Wikipedia
Born: October 5, 1955 (age 64 years), Ipswich, United Kingdom
Office: Member of Parliament of the United Kingdom since 2005
Education: Gonville & Caius College, University of Cambridge, Glenalmond College","When he ran the now-defunct Financial Services Authority, during the great banking crisis of 2009, Adair Turner summoned up the courage to tell the world that much of what occurs in financial markets is “socially useless”, trading systems designed to shave the last shred of profit out of transactions fairly or not, legally or not, yielded little if anything for the common good. This book takes many of the themes and presentations that the author used during his time at the FSA and turns them into a strong narrative and powerful argument for reform, but what he wins on fluency the author tends to lose on originality.",https://www.academia.edu/29639712/Hall_of_Mirrors_by_Barry_Eichengreen
15,Economics,Capital in the Twenty-First Century,452,Thomas Piketty,"(born 7 May 1971) is a French economist whose work focuses on wealth and income inequality. He is a professor (directeur d'études) at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (EHESS), associate chair at the Paris School of Economics and Centennial professor at the International Inequalities Institute, which is part of the London School of Economics (LSE).
Piketty is the author of the best-selling book Capital in the Twenty-First Century (2013), which emphasises the themes of his work on wealth concentrations and distribution over the past 250 years. The book argues that the rate of capital return in developed countries is persistently greater than the rate of economic growth, and that this will cause wealth inequality to increase in the future. To address this problem Piketty proposes redistribution through a progressive global tax on wealth.","With its proposal for a global tax on wealth, this makes for uncomfortable, if necessary, reading for the richest citizens of today. With a vast historical and geographical sweep, this French economist, through this work, is sometimes credited with re-inventing economics in the same way that JM Keynes did eighty years ago. He doesn’t, but in the absence of anything more convincing, his redistributionist solutions may prove the antidote to Trumpism, when the time comes.","https://dowbor.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/14Thomas-Piketty.pdf	"
16,Self-Care,Remember This When You’re Sad: Lessons Learned on the Road from Self-Harm to Self-Care,288,Maggy van Eijk,"Maggy van Eijk writes about mental health, pop culture and motherhood. She is the author of Remember This When You're Sad.  ","Funny, irreverent and unflinchingly honest, Remember This When You’re Sad is both a memoir and a vital self-care manual. Writer and social-media editor Van Eijk, in her own words, turns her brain “inside out” on the page. She shares her own story of lifetime suffering with mental-health issues – including depression, anxiety and borderline personality disorder – and pairs it with pragmatic advice for those facing similar issues.

The book is divided into 15 digestible chapters with to-the-point heads, such as “Remember this when you’re scared of your own brain” and “Remember this when you can’t stand your own body”. What follows is razor-sharp prose that reads like advice and anecdotes from a trusted friend.

Van Eijk tackles traumatic incidents from her own past, such as the time she badly burnt her forearm with cigarettes, with lightness and even humour. A self-professed lover of lists, she punctures the prose with bulleted sections designed to help the reader take better care of themselves. Themes include “things you could do instead of self harm” and “not-so-cringeworthy mantras that help me”. A raw and comforting read.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36761552-remember-this-when-you-re-sad
17,Self-Care,The Self-Care Project: How To Let Go Of Frazzle And Make Time For You,200,Jayne Hardy,"Jayne Hardy is the founder and CEO of The Blurt Foundation - a social enterprise dedicated to helping those affected by depression. Jayne lives in Cornwall with her husband, their daughter, and their dog. She has spoken, and written, about her own experiences of depression and self-care on BBC Radio 2, at TEDxBrum, and in publications such as Huffington Post, Grazia and Virgin.com, to name a few. Her innovative use of the internet to bring about positive social change was recognised from the off. She won the TalkTalk Digital Hero Award in 2011, and in 2014 was included in Marketing Magazine's list of Top Ten Digital Mavericks. Jayne has been mentioned as one of the 19 inspirational women leading the way in mental health by Rethink as part of their International Women's Day celebration. In 2016, Jayne led the viral #whatyoudontsee social media campaign.","The Self-Care Project busts the myth that self-care is “selfish”, presenting it instead as imperative for our overall health, happiness and wellbeing. It’s written by someone who knows firsthand the impact of neglecting self-care. Jayne Hardy is the founder and CEO of mental-health charity The Blurt Foundation and depression, as she writes in an early chapter, “gobbled up most of her twenties”. It was being unable to undertake “the most basic acts of self-care” – she lost a molar as she “didn’t feel worthy enough” to brush her teeth – that led Hardy to set up her foundation and ultimately write this self-care handbook. In its essence, Hardy writes, self-care is about taking responsibility for yourself. That means being “hyper-aware” of how you feel and making choices accordingly. In 10 practical chapters, Hardy offers straightforward advice on how to assess your own needs and build self-care into an already busy schedule – tips range from changing your relationship with your phone to creating the ultimate “comfort retreat”. Each chapter concludes with an interactive exercise that helps you unpack what self-care means to you, from writing down your fears to listing things that comfort you on “lemon-pelting days”. You should finish the book with a better understanding of your own wants, needs and boundaries.","	http://files.constantcontact.com/536abec0701/dc3be7f8-95f7-474f-bd66-ca7486eede1c.pdf	"
18,Self-Care,"Take A Moment: Activities to Refocus, Recentre And Relax Wherever You Are",128,in partnership with Mind and Michael O’Mara,Mind is a mental health charity based in England and Wales.,"Described as a “self-care companion”, this colourful guide was created in partnership with mental health charity Mind, and all the proceeds go to the organisation.

Affirming quotes are peppered throughout, including Aristotle’s “knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom”. This sets the tone of the book, which is about developing your own methods for managing stress and anxiety – or discovering “simple everyday things you could do to care for yourself”.

The book begins with breathing practices, and encourages you to write down any niggling thoughts and feelings early on, so you can focus on the activities that follow. From here, exercises include physical ones, such as a “body scan” and stretching routines, plus creative tasks that encourage things like doodling. There are also pages dedicated to dealing with panic attacks and those that help break down a daunting task, be it applying for a new job or simply leaving the house. Designed for use on the go, it easily slips into a handbag or rucksack too. A practical and accessible guide to self-care.",
